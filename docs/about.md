`nuclear` is a declarative parser for command line interfaces in Python.
It's a binding glue between CLI shell arguments and functions being invoked.
It mostly focuses on building multi level command trees.

`nuclear` parses and validates command line arguments provided by user when running console application.
Then it automatically triggers matched action, based on the declared Command-Line Interface rules, injecting all needed parameters.
You don't need to write the "glue" code for binding & parsing parameters every time.
So it makes writing console aplications simpler and more clear.
